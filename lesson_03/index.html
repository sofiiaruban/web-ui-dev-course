        <p>
          Ukraine is a country in Eastern Europe. It is the second-largest
          country in Europe after Russia, which borders it to the east and
          northeast. Ukraine also borders Belarus to the north; Poland and
          Slovakia to the west; Hungary, Romania and Moldova[c] to the
          southwest; and the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov to the south and
          southeast. Kyiv is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by
          Kharkiv, Odesa, and Dnipro. Ukraine's official language is
          <span class="bold">Ukrainian</span>.

        <h3 class="bold subtitle">Early history</h3>
        <p>
          Evidence for the earliest securely dated hominin presence in Europe
          comes from 1.4 million-year-old stone tools from Korolevo, in western
          Ukraine. Settlement by modern humans in Ukraine and its vicinity dates
          back to 32,000 BC, with evidence of the Gravettian culture in the
          Crimean Mountains.
        </p>
        <h3 class="bold subtitle">Golden Age of Kyiv</h3>
        <p>
          The establishment of the state of Kievan Rus' remains obscure and
          uncertain. The state included much of present-day Ukraine, Belarus and
          the western part of European Russia. According to the Primary
          Chronicle, the Rus' people initially consisted of Varangians from
          Scandinavia. In 882, the pagan Prince Oleg (Oleh) conquered Kyiv from
          Askold and Dir and proclaimed it as the new capital of the
          Rus'.Anti-Normanist historians however argue that the East Slavic
          tribes along the southern parts of the Dnieper River were already in
          the process of forming a state independently. The Varangian elite,
          including the ruling Rurik dynasty, later assimilated into the Slavic
          population. Kievan Rus' was composed of several principalities ruled
          by the interrelated Rurikid kniazes ("princes"), who often fought each
          other for possession of Kyiv
        </p>
        <h3 class="bold subtitle">Cossack Hetmanate</h3>
        <p>
          Deprived of native protectors among the Ruthenian nobility, the
          peasants and townspeople began turning for protection to the emerging
          Zaporozhian Cossacks. In the mid-17th century, a Cossack military
          quasi-state, the Zaporozhian Host, was formed by Dnieper Cossacks and
          Ruthenian peasants. Poland exercised little real control over this
          population, but found the Cossacks to be useful against the Turks and
          Tatars,and at times the two were allies in military campaigns.
          However, the continued harsh enserfment of Ruthenian peasantry by
          Polish szlachta (many of whom were Polonised Ruthenian nobles) and the
          suppression of the Orthodox Church alienated the Cossacks. The latter
          did not shy from taking up arms against those they perceived as
          enemies and occupiers, including the Catholic Church with its local
          representatives.
        </p>
        <h3 class="bold subtitle">19th and early 20th century</h3>
        <p>
          The 19th century saw the rise of Ukrainian nationalism. With growing
          urbanisation and modernisation and a cultural trend toward romantic
          nationalism, a Ukrainian intelligentsia committed to national rebirth
          and social justice emerged. The serf-turned-national-poet
          <span class="bold">Taras Shevchenko</span> (1814–1861) and political
          theorist Mykhailo Drahomanov (1841–1895) led the growing nationalist
          movement. While conditions for its development in Austrian Galicia
          under the Habsburgs were relatively lenient, the Russian part faced
          severe restrictions, going as far as banning virtually all books from
          being published in Ukrainian in 1876.

        <h3 class="bold subtitle">Independence</h3>
        <p>
          As part of the so-called parade of sovereignties, on 16 July 1990, the
          newly elected Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist
          Republic adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine.

        <h2 class="bold">Geography</h2>
        <p>
          Ukraine is the second-largest European country, after Russia, and the
          largest country entirely in Europe. Lying between latitudes 44° and
          53° N, and longitudes 22° and 41° E., it is mostly in the East
          European Plain. Ukraine covers an area of 603,550 square kilometres
          (233,030 sq mi), with a coastline of 2,782 kilometres (1,729 mi).
        </p>
        <h3 class="bold subtitle">Climate</h3>
        <p>
          Ukraine is in the mid-latitudes, and generally has a continental
          climate, except for its southern coasts, which have cold semi-arid and
          humid subtropical climates. Average annual temperatures range from
          5.5–7 °C (41.9–44.6 °F) in the north, to 11–13 °C (51.8–55.4 °F) in
          the south.[185] Precipitation is highest in the west and north and
          lowest in the east and southeast.[185] Western Ukraine, particularly
          in the Carpathian Mountains, receives around 120 centimetres (47.2 in)
          of precipitation annually, while Crimea and the coastal areas of the
          Black Sea receive around 40 centimetres (15.7 in)
        </p>
        <h3 class="bold subtitle">Biodiversity</h3>
        <p>
          Ukraine contains six terrestrial ecoregions: Central European mixed
          forests, Crimean Submediterranean forest complex, East European forest
          steppe, Pannonian mixed forests, Carpathian montane conifer forests,
          and Pontic steppe.[189] There is somewhat more coniferous than
          deciduous forest.[190] The most densely forested area is Polisia in
          the northwest, with pine, oak, and birch.[190] There are 45,000
          species of animals (mostly invertebrates),[191] with approximately 385
          endangered species listed in the Red Data Book of Ukraine.[192]
          Internationally important wetlands cover over 7,000 square kilometres
          (2,700 sq mi), with the Danube Delta being important for conservation.
        </p>
        <h3 class="bold subtitle">Urban areas</h3>
        <p>
          Ukraine has 457 cities, of which 176 are designated as oblast-class,
          279 as smaller raion-class cities, and two as special legal status
          cities. There are also 886 urban-type settlements and 28,552 villages
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="culture" class="culture-section">
        <h2 class="bold title">Culture</h2>
        <p>
          Ukrainian customs are heavily influenced by Orthodox Christianity, the
          dominant religion in the country.[372] Gender roles also tend to be
          more traditional, and grandparents play a greater role in bringing up
          children, than in the West.[373] The culture of Ukraine has also been
          influenced by its eastern and western neighbours, reflected in its
          architecture, music and art
        </p>
        <h3 class="bold">Literature</h3>
        <p>
          Ukrainian literature has origins in Old Church Slavonic writings,
          which was used as a liturgical and literary language following
          Christianisation in the 10th and 11th centuries.[387][388][better
          source needed][g] Other writings from the time include chronicles, the
          most significant of which was the Primary Chronicle.[citation needed]
          Literary activity faced a sudden decline after the Mongol invasion of
          Kievan Rus', before seeing a revival beginning in the 14th century,
          and was advanced in the 16th century with the invention of the
          printing press.
        </p>
        <h3 class="bold">Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          Ukrainian architecture includes the motifs and styles that are found
          in structures built in modern Ukraine, and by Ukrainians worldwide.
          These include initial roots which were established in the state of
          Kievan Rus'. Following the Christianisation of Kievan Rus', Ukrainian
          architecture has been influenced by Byzantine architecture. After the
          Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus', the Galician style continued to
          develop in the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia.
        </p>
        <h3 class="bold">Weaving and embroidery</h3>
        <p>
          Artisan textile arts play an important role in Ukrainian culture,[396]
          especially in Ukrainian wedding traditions. Ukrainian embroidery,
          weaving and lace-making are used in traditional folk dress and in
          traditional celebrations. Ukrainian embroidery varies depending on the
          region of origin[397] and the designs have a long history of motifs,
          compositions, choice of colours and types of stitches.[398] Use of
          colour is very important and has roots in Ukrainian folklore.
          Embroidery motifs found in different parts of Ukraine are preserved in
          the Rushnyk Museum in Pereiaslav.
        </p>
        <h3 class="bold">Music</h3>
        <p>
          Music is a major part of Ukrainian culture, with a long history and
          many influences. From traditional folk music, to classical and modern
          rock, Ukraine has produced several internationally recognised
          musicians including Kirill Karabits, Okean Elzy and Ruslana. Elements
          from traditional Ukrainian folk music made their way into Western
          music and even into modern jazz. Ukrainian music sometimes presents a
          perplexing mix of exotic melismatic singing with chordal harmony. The
          most striking general characteristic of authentic ethnic Ukrainian
          folk music is the wide use of minor modes or keys which incorporate
          augmented second intervals.

          >
          has been formed by the nation's tumultuous history, geography, culture
          and social customs. Chicken is the most consumed type of protein,
          accounting for about half of the meat intake. It is followed by pork
          and beef. Vegetables such as potatoes, cabbages, mushrooms and
          beetroots are widely consumed.[419] Pickled vegetables are considered
          a delicacy. Salo, which is cured pork fat, is considered the national
          delicacy. Widely used herbs include dill, parsley, basil, coriander
          and chives.
